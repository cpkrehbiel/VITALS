# Repository Setup Instructions

The how-tos and tutorials in this repository require a [NASA Earthdata account](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/), an installation of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and a compatible Python Environment. Resources in the VITALS repository have been developed using the Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub cloud workspace.

For local Python environment setup we recommend using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage Python packages. To install *mamba*, download [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) for your operating system.  If using Windows, be sure to check the box to "Add mamba to my PATH environment variable" to enable use of mamba directly from your command line interface. **Note that this may cause an issue if you have an existing mamba install through Anaconda.**  

## Python Environment Setup

These Python Environments will work for all of the guides, how-to's, and tutorials within this repository.

1. Using your preferred command line interface (command prompt, terminal, cmder, etc.) navigate to your local copy of the repository, then type the following to create a compatible Python environment.

    For Windows:

    ```cmd
    mamba create -n lpdaac_vitals -c conda-forge --yes python=3.10 fiona=1.8.22 gdal hvplot geoviews rioxarray rasterio jupyter geopandas earthaccess jupyter_bokeh h5py h5netcdf spectral scikit-image jupyterlab seaborn dask ray-default
    ```

    For MacOSX:

    ```cmd
    mamba create -n lpdaac_vitals -c conda-forge --yes python=3.10 gdal=3.7.2 hvplot geoviews rioxarray rasterio geopandas fiona=1.9.4 jupyter earthaccess jupyter_bokeh h5py h5netcdf spectral scikit-image seaborn jupyterlab dask ray-default ray-dashboard
    ```

2. Next, activate the Python Environment that you just created.

    ```cmd
    mamba activate lpdaac_vitals 
    ```

3. Now you can launch Jupyter Notebook to open the notebooks included.

    ```cmd
    jupyter notebook 
    ```

## Cloning the VITALS Repository

If you plan to edit or contribute to the VITALS repository, we recommend following a fork and pull workflow: first fork the repository, then clone your fork to your local machine, make changes, push changes to your fork, then make a pull request back to the main repository. An example can be found in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

If you just want to work with the notebooks or modules, you can simply clone or download the repository.

To clone the repository, navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository on your local machine, then type the following:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/nasa/VITALS.git
```
